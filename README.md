# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data Course project
My Getting and Cleaning Data course projects script is called ' Final script - Rob Oudehand' , it does the following:

- It merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

The results of my project are saved into ' tidyData.txt' , which you can find on this github repository
